A plugin that integrates ChatGPT to generate documentation directly within IntelliJ IDEA and other intellij IDEs.\

---


After installing the plugin, add your openAI api key and select the model to use, as well as the type of documentation to create in IntelliJ’s settings. You can then open the tool window - clicking on “Generate documentation” will send the opened file’s code to ChatGPT, which will produce the documented code. After creation, copy the output or use it however you like.
